===================
Pretty basic header file for C/++ programs. Provides crashes error information handling.

Internal fns:

die(enum CRASH_CODE, char*)
- CRASH_CODE can be got with:
        
            extern enum CRASH_CODE
- the char* is a custom message outputted when the program crashes.

See source for CRASH_CODE info
